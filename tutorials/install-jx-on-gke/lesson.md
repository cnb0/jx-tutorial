# Creating your first JX install on GKE

## Let's get started!

This guide will show you how to install `jx` and use it to create a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine.

**Time to complete**: About 25 minutes

Click the **Next** button to move to the next step.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial you need to:

  * Create and/or select a project.
  
      * To create a project: `gcloud projects create <project-name>`
      
      * To select the project in which this tutorial will be executed: `gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>`
         
  * Billing must be enabled (note there's a $300 credit, free tier for new accounts)

## Step 1 - Installing Dependencies

The first thing we need to do is install the `jx` binary and add it to your PATH.

```bash
source ./install-jx.sh
```

**Tip**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box and paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal to run it.

This may take a few minutes to complete as it downloads everything it requires.

## Step 2 - Create a cluster

To create the cluster, run the following:

```bash
jx create cluster gke --skip-login
```

This will guide you through creating a cluster on GKE.

### Missing Dependencies

JX will attempt to locate any required dependencies, if it discovers that some are missing
it will prompt to install them for you in the `~/.jx/bin` folder.  It is recommended that
you allow `jx` to install any missing dependencies.

### Configure your cluster

JX will then provide you with defaults for the basic configuration options for your cluster. You will be prompted to make some selections, for example:

* Google Cloud Zone: select a zone that is near to you

The defaults provided include:
* A generated name for your cluster
* Cluster type: `Zonal`
* Machine type: `n1-standard-2`
* Minimum number of Nodes: `3`
* Maximum number of Nodes: `5`
* Use of preemptible VMs: `No`
* Access Google Cloud Storage / Google Container Registry: `Yes`
* Enable Cloud Build, Container Registry & Container Analysis APIs: `Yes`
* Enable Kaniko for building container images: `No`

Your cluster < name > in < zone > should be created for you. ðŸŽ‰

### GitHub connectivity

If this is the first time you have run `jx` in this cloudshell, `jx` will prompt you for a 
github username & api token.  If you already have one, simply enter the values when prompted. 
If you don't have an api token, click on the link provided to generated one and enter the 
token value into the prompt.

### Jenkins Installation  

* Select Jenkins installation type: recommended is `Serverless Jenkins X Pipelines with Tekton`

A number of settings will be configured for you, such as installing an ingress controller.

* If you are asked the name you wish to use with git: `enter your GitHub user name`
* If you are asked the email address you wish to use with git: `enter your GitHub email`

* You will be prompted for Domain .nip.io: `Accept the proposed domain by pressing Enter`

* Do you wish to use < your GitHub user name > as the local Git user for GitHub server: `y`
* Do you wish to use GitHub as the pipelines Git server: `y`

* Workload build pack should default to: `Kubernetes Workloads: Automated CI+CD with GitOps Promotion`

Jenkins X should be installed on your Kubernetes cluster. ðŸŽ‰

To see the Jenkins X environments that have been created, the corresponding GitOps git repos, and the default promotion strategy between environments:

```bash
jx get environments
```
You should see something similar to:

```
NAME       LABEL       KIND        PROMOTE NAMESPACE     ORDER CLUSTER SOURCE                                                       REF PR
dev        Development Development Never   jx            0
staging    Staging     Permanent   Auto    jx-staging    100           https://github.com/MarckK/environment-hunternoble-staging.git
production Production  Permanent   Manual  jx-production 200           https://github.com/MarckK/environment-hunternoble-production.git
```

Note the following details in the PROMOTE column:
* Development has **Never** promote, because you're working locally in this environment and not deploying anything.
* The Staging environment's default is to **Auto** promote, meaning any merge performed on the repo's master branch will automatically be deployed as a new version to staging.
* The Production environment's default is to have a **Manual** promotion strategy, meaning that you will have to manually promote your staging application version into production by using a jx promotion command.

The SOURCE column shows each environment's configuration git repo.

## Step 3 - Create an app

Now that you have a working cluster with Jenkins X installed, you are going to create an
application that can be built & deployed with Jenkins X.

### Using a quickstart

JX has a `create quickstart` command that will create a build from a standardised template.
To run this command, type the following:

```bash
jx create quickstart
```

For this example, lets select `golang-http`.

* Do you wish to use < your GitHub user name > as the Git user name? `y`
* Enter the new repository name: choose a name for your new application, such
as `cloudshell-tutorial`

JX will then guide you through setting up the git repository for the application.

If this is the first application you have created, it may take a few minutes to download all
of the required builder images in order to build/deploy the application.  

To view the status of the app, you can use the following:

```bash
jx get activity -f cloudshell-tutorial -w
```

You can list the pipelines via:

```bash
jx get pipelines
```

When the pipeline is complete, to view the app in each environment along with urls:

```bash
jx get applications
```

### Promote the app to production

Using the `jx promote` command, you can push this version from staging to
production.

```bash
cd cloudshell-tutorial
```
_If you have 2FA enabled on your GitHub account, then you may need to use an api token as your password when prompted._

```bash
jx promote cloudshell-tutorial --version 0.0.1 --env production
```

You can check the progress of the production deployment using:

```bash
jx get activity -f cloudshell-tutorial -w
```

```bash
jx get applications
```

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Youâ€™re all set!

You now have a fully configured Jenkins-X installation on Google Kubernetes Engine.

To avoid running up unnecessary costs, you may wish to shut down your kubernetes cluster at this point.  To view all clusters running with the current account use:

```bash
gcloud container clusters list
```

To delete the cluster run:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete <clustername> --zone <zone>
```
